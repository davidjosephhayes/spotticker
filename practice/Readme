-Adrian Sanabria-Diaz

Once the Raspberry Pi has been set up with the Raspbian, 
run the following commands in the terminal to Download and install an ARM version of Node.js:

wget http://node-arm.herokuapp.com/node_latest_armhf.deb 
sudo dpkg -i node_latest_armhf.deb

// I ran into an error that was resolved after running the following command: 

npm install socket.io

//Automatically turn on node.js on boot
